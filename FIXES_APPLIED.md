# Fixes Applied to SimplePOS Electron

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `installments:getActivePlans` Handler âœ…
**Problem**: The handler for getting active installment plans was not implemented.

**Solution**: Added a comprehensive handler that:
- Fetches all active installment plans
- Includes customer information
- Calculates payment progress
- Shows next due date
- Returns paid/total count

### 2. NOT NULL Constraint on `down_payment` âœ…
**Problem**: The database required a `down_payment` value but the frontend wasn't always sending it.

**Solution**: 
- Added default values for optional fields:
  - `down_payment`: defaults to 0
  - `fee`: defaults to 0
  - `count`: supports both `count` and `num_installments` field names
  - `rounding_mode`: defaults to 'bankers'
- Updated frontend to send all required fields

### 3. Customer Information in Overdue Installments âœ…
**Problem**: Customer names weren't showing in the overdue installments list.

**Solution**: Updated the query to include customer information via LEFT JOIN.
